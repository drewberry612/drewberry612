## 🎉 Fun Facts 
- 🔍 I’ve never used an inbuilt debugging tool—I do it all myself and am pretty damn good at it!

- ⏳ Coding tunnel vision is real! I’ve lost track of time coding for 5-6 hours, and in that time, I've not had a single drop of water.

- 🎶 I listen to music while coding but get so focused that I end up completely ignoring the tunes. My mind’s too wrapped up in the problem at hand!

- 🧗‍♂️ I boulder 2-3 times a week, constantly solving complex physical and mental problems while climbing.

- ✨ I’m fascinated by GenAI models with memory systems that can remember things intelligently without needing explicit prompts.

- 💡 One memorable moment early in my career: I spent a whole day trying to fix a bug, then took a 2-minute break—and in that moment, the solution came to me like an epiphany. Sometimes the best ideas hit when you step away for a second!
